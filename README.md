Conway's Game of Life

Simulation is written in C# (WPF).

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The action take place on a two-dimnesional grid. The rules are very simple:

    1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
    2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
    4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
    
Effects of the simulation can be really interesting and the simple rules make it even more fascinating.
Here I found a short video with example simulations:
